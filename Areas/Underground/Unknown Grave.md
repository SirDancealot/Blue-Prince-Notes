behind the room with the [[Chess]] puzzle

Has 8 [[Mora Jai Box]]s each with a note with some cryptic hint
- In aries court where the king now lays
- on the sacred hour that timeworn phrase (enter during the sacred hour)
- will a youth approach with empty arms 
- without gifts nor gold nor mannered charms (no items or gold probably also no keys or gems)

- And in sky above a brilliant sign
- a sullen cross as five stars align (on a day with the more 4-way intersections start signa)
- a patient figure a reckoning great
- the black key is lying with the last king of eight

When all above are fufilled the grave rises and there is a clock where a time can be set:
